This project improves the efficiency of the taxi business by predictive modelling and addresses
the environmental effect of taxis in New York City. A comprehensive dataset including several spa-
tiotemporal characteristics and past demand trends is used in this work. Considering their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and ease of implementation, this work investigates the application of deep
learning methods. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) fully connected neural networks (FNN), re-
current neural networks (RNN), and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) are among
the deep learning techniques that will be examined, but an LSTM model will be used primarily be-
cause of its ability to capture temporal dependencies in the data. The paper will also have a critical
discussion contrasting deep learning techniques with conventional statistical methods, aiming to find
out if the complexity and resource demands of deep learning provide appreciable benefits, especially in
the context of automation and predictive analytics for ridesharing services.
